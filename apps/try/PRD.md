# BLAH - Barely Logical Agent Host
## Product Requirements Document

This document outlines the requirements and roadmap for completing the BLAH project, a universal protocol adapter for AI agent tools.

## Project Overview
BLAH (Barely Logical Agent Host) provides a unified platform for AI agent tools, allowing developers to write tools once and use them across multiple agent frameworks. It supports various protocols (MCP, SLOP) and offers both local and remote server capabilities.

## Requirements Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [x] Initial application setup with Next.js
- [x] Basic UI components following PrecisionCore design system
- [x] Google/Spotlight search interface implementation
- [ ] Implement actual search functionality (currently mocked)
- [ ] Create API endpoints for searching tools and servers
- [ ] Implement actual settings functionality (currently UI only)

### MCP Integration
- [ ] Implement MCP client connectivity
- [ ] Add server discovery functionality
- [ ] Create tool registry and browsing interface
- [ ] Support both local and remote MCP server connections
- [ ] Implement tool execution capabilities
- [ ] Add authentication for remote MCP servers

### User Experience
- [x] Implement responsive design
- [x] Create feature highlights section
- [ ] Add user onboarding/tutorial
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle (supported by design system)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] Implement command history and suggestions

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete user documentation
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create quickstart guides

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement analytics
- [ ] Add error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for various platforms
- [ ] Set up monitoring for remote MCP server status

### Community Features
- [ ] Add tool submission interface
- [ ] Implement tool rating and reviews
- [ ] Create community showcase section
- [ ] Add user profile and saved tools
- [ ] Implement sharing functionality

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Experience (Current)
- Complete the search interface implementation
- Connect to real MCP servers
- Implement basic tool discovery and execution

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Enhance the tool registry with categories and tags
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Implement tool chain workflows
- Add monitoring and analytics

### Phase 3: Community Growth
- Launch public tool registry
- Add developer portal
- Implement marketplace features
- Create showcases and tutorials

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure all components follow the PrecisionCore design system
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes
- Optimize performance for search and tool discovery
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics
- Number of active users
- Number of registered tools
- Tool execution count
- User retention rate
- Developer adoption

This PRD will be updated as the project evolves. The team should refer to this document to track progress and ensure all requirements are met before launch.
