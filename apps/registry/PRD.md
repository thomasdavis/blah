Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Overview
   1.1 Vision
   Build a robust, scalable public registry of compute that allows developers to publish, share, and consume functions and tools with versioning and flexible execution options. This registry is intended to replace legacy systems (such as ValTown) with a modern platform that supports multi-provider execution (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Functions) and leverages a reliable backend (e.g., PostgreSQL) for code storage and metadata management.

1.2 Objectives
Public Registry: Provide a marketplace where users can search, discover, and import compute functions/tools.

Versioning & Dependency Management: Offer version control for published functions similar to npm.

Multi-Provider Execution: Allow functions to be executed via configurable providers.

User Authentication & Authorization: Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can publish, update, or delete content.

Extensibility: Support multiple compute providers and future protocols without extensive rework.

2. Background and Context
   2.1 Problem Statement
   Current solutions for function execution registries are limited in flexibility, provider support, and developer workflow. Users need a system that not only stores and versions their compute functions but also integrates seamlessly with various serverless execution platforms. Moreover, robust authentication and fine-grained permissions are required to secure the ecosystem.

2.2 Market Comparison
npm: Provides package management and versioning for code libraries, but not dedicated compute functions.

Serverless Platforms: Often tie compute functions to a specific provider.

Existing Registries (e.g., ValTown): Limited by legacy design, lack of versioning, and less flexible execution options.

3. Product Description

4. User Roles & Workflows
   4.1 User Roles
   Developer/Contributor:

Publishes new functions or updates existing ones.

Views version history, manages dependencies, and monitors execution logs.

Consumer:

Discovers and imports functions/tools into their projects.

Provides ratings and feedback.

Administrator:

Manages user roles, reviews flagged content, and oversees system health.

Automated Systems/CI Pipelines:

Publishes and updates functions via API using secured tokens.

4.2 Key User Workflows
4.2.1 Publishing a Function
Developer logs in via CLI or web UI.

The developer initializes a new function project using a template (e.g., registry.json).

After coding and local testing, the developer runs publish command.

The function is versioned, metadata is stored in PostgreSQL, and the code is deployed (e.g., to Cloudflare Workers).

A confirmation is sent via email/notification.

4.2.2 Discovering and Importing a Function
A consumer visits the registry web UI.

The consumer searches for functions by name, tag, or provider.

The functionâ€™s detail page shows documentation, version history, and usage instructions.

The consumer copies the import command (CLI or SDK) to integrate the function into their project.

The system validates dependencies and compatibility.

4.2.3 Execution & Monitoring
A consumer or automated system triggers a function via CLI or API.

The registry routes the request to the selected execution provider.

Execution logs, performance metrics, and error handling are captured and stored.

Feedback is provided through the UI and via webhook notifications.

5. Technical Architecture
   5.1 Frontend
   Web Dashboard:

Built with modern frameworks (e.g., React or Vue).

Responsive design for desktop and mobile use.

Integration with the backend API for data retrieval and publishing.

5.2 Backend Services
API Server:

RESTful endpoints for user management, function publishing, discovery, and execution.

Real-time notifications via websockets or SSE.

Database Layer:

PostgreSQL for relational data.

Caching layer (e.g., Redis) for high-frequency queries.

Function Execution Layer:

Abstraction over multiple providers.

Provider-specific modules to handle deployment, invocation, and logging.

CLI & SDK:

Node.js-based CLI tool integrated with the backend.

SDK packages available via package managers.

5.3 Security & Monitoring
Authentication & Authorization:

JWT tokens for API security.

OAuth integrations for third-party authentication.

Logging & Analytics:

Centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack or similar).

Monitoring dashboards for function performance and system health.

Scalability:

Horizontal scaling for API servers.

Load balancers and auto-scaling for execution environments.

Backup & Recovery:

Regular database backups and failover mechanisms.
