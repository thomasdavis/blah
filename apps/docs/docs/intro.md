# Introduction to BLAH

**BLAH (Barely Logical Agent Host)** is an open-source ecosystem for managing, distributing, and executing AI agent tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a decentralized registry for MCP servers that promotes transparency, security, and community-driven development.

## What is BLAH?

BLAH is designed to be the foundation for a new generation of AI tools that can be easily shared, discovered, and composed. It provides:

- **Open-source infrastructure** that any system (IDE, AI platform, etc.) can connect to
- **Language-agnostic tool registry** supporting unlimited tool selection
- **Robust security** through optional signing and verification of MCP servers
- **Comprehensive CLI** for publishing, discovering, and managing tools
- **Support for various tool types**: functions, REST endpoints, local files, or standard manifests

## The Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to discover, select, and execute tools. BLAH implements MCP to create a consistent interface between:

1. **Tool Providers**: Developers who create useful functions for AI models
2. **AI Models**: Large language models that can use tools to enhance their capabilities
3. **Clients**: Applications that connect models with tools (IDEs, chat interfaces, etc.)

## Key Features

### For Developers

- Create and publish tools that extend AI capabilities
- Host your own MCP server or use the BLAH registry
- Test tools with built-in simulation capabilities
- Integrate with existing development workflows

### For Users

- Access a rich ecosystem of AI tools through compatible clients
- Combine tools from different providers for powerful workflows
- Ensure security through verification of tool sources
- Create custom agent workflows with the Flow Editor

## Project Structure

BLAH is organized as a monorepo using Turborepo with these main components:

- `packages/cli`: The main BLAH CLI tool for working with MCP
- `packages/schema`: JSON Schema definitions for BLAH manifests
- `apps/web`: Web interface for BLAH
- `apps/docs`: This documentation site

## Vision

We envision a future where:

1. **Anyone** can create and share tools that extend AI capabilities
2. **Everyone** has access to a rich ecosystem of tools regardless of their technical background
3. **Every system** can integrate with this ecosystem through standard protocols
